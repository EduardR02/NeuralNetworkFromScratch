# NeuralNetworkFromScratch
This is a neural network from scratch with MNIST as the dataset for training

You can choose between sigmoid and relu and you can have multiple hidden layers. The last layer is always softmax.
If you train a model the layers will automatically be saved as a .npy file and can be loaded either for training or evaluating.
There are probably some mistakes as this is the first time I am writing a NN from scratch.

# Requirements
install mnist from the command line that's it
also the numba stuff is not necessary
